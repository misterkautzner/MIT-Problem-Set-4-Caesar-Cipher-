Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:


Iterate over the possible keys (0 - 26)
Decode using the current key
Separate text into words based on spacing
Test each word to see if it's valid
Total the number of valid words for the key
Compare current total to the max total (so far)
If the current total is greater than the max total,
	set the value of max total to the current total
Update the value of the max total key to the value of the
	current key
After trying all keys, return the max total key



Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

Find the best shift()
record the shift
count number of valid words
if all words are valid, return the shifts

Call Find the best shifts() with the end of the last valid word
	as the starting point
